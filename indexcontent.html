 <H3> Week 7 The Return (B- November 24th) </>
 <p> I've been able to run the software for the SensorHat for the raspberry pi, unfortunatley I wasn't able to get the sensor to work in class as i had some issues with my display on the touch
     display for the pi. Afterwards in my own time I was able to get some of the sensors to work, but I unfortunatley was not able to get the display to work with the sesnors at the same time
     because the display uses some of the same IC2 ports as the sensors. I'm going to try and get my second pi set up for vnc and with all of the sensors before the next class. As well as
     get some of my own code started for my morse code.

 <H3> Week 6 The Return (B- November 24th) </>
 <p> So what I've done in the past 5 weeks includes getting all of my parts for my project, I've completed my sensor hat pcb board and retrieved its sensor components(minimul adjustments required).
	 The soldering of the pcb board had a hiccup. I had soldered the 24 pin connector upside down, so I had to remove it and reconnect it. Upside to that is I got alot of desoldering experience. 
	 I also damaged some copper traces while removing the connector and so i had to jury-rig a solution. I ended up soldering a left over resistor lead over the gap in the trace and making an 
	 intentional solder bridge over another trace that slightly damage. I tested the functionality of the sensor had with Vlad testing setup in the proto type lab and it worked without a problem!
	

	 
	 I also have a image created for both of my pies so that the touch screen function. Currently only one has its image installed, but I don't suspect the other is going to have any issues. As the
	 process of installing the first one onto a 128 GB chip had some of its own unforseen difficulties but the other chip that I need to install on is only 32 GB so i should be able to do it without
	 funky drive wizardry. (Its not actually magic of course but it was very finiky that once I got it right it may as well of been magic) </p>
